This is a modular shopping cart system written in the Zend Framework (http://framework.zend.com/). 
Doctrine (http://www.doctrine-project.org/) is used as the object relational management system.
I used ZFDoctrine, a Doctrine 1.2 port to the Zend Framework.

Simple Store is inspired by Magento. Although Magento is supposedly built on top of the Zend Framework,
Magento has its own application framework and bears very little resemblance to the conventions of
a typical ZF application. Although, I am very comfortable with Magento, having developed for it
at work, this is a Zend Framework project through and through. The application structure of this 
project bears no relation to Magento.
